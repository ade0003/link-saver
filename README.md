# Link Saver
A  Chrome extension to organize links and view them later in a dashboard. Built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Why

The internet is full of interesting articles and useful resources  but it’s easy to lose track of them. I built Link Saver because I constantly find resources I want to revisit later but struggle to keep them organized. I wanted a solution that was fast, simple, and didn’t require signing up for yet ***another*** account. With this Chrome extension, you can save links instantly and access them anytime on a dedicated dashboard. No clutter, no unnecessary features—just a clean and efficient way to keep track of what matters to you.
